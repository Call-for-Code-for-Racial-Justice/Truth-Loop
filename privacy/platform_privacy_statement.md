### About the “Truth Loop” Platform Project

The “Truth Loop” Platform Project is provided as a portal for those who wish to upload their own content:

- Because for too long peoples of race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin – as well as peoples of good conscience - have patiently awaited the arrival of equality, the moment has now revealed itself that members of free and democratic societies around the world are no longer willing to accept the extreme prejudices and biases of the past;
- Because the moment must now be seized to press ahead with reforms and material changes to institutions, policies, regulations and governance structures, in order to ensure that positive, impactful and meaningful change is made so that peoples of race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin may enjoy the benefits to which they are all equally entitled to;
- Because a long history of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same objectives of discrimination, profiling or restriction, evinces a design to remove them, it is their right to throw off such violations to human dignity and to provide new guards for future security, welfare and prosperity;
- Because no group or body should be capable of exerting undue power and control over others in any sphere, whether that be public or private, and that no one should face discrimination, profiling or restrictions based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin;
- Because all individuals are created equally and no person should be denied this right based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin;

"Truth Loop" is an easy-to-use platform that stores and curates relevant policies, regulations, and legislation (PR&L) to help the Black community better understand the PR&L that might affect them most. Truth Loop clarifies and simplifies PR&L, increases the community's legal awareness, and provides a platform to gather video testimonials and responses that can be shared among community members and with policymakers legislators, advocacy groups and other interested parties. In these video testimonials, community members can share their experiences around how policies have impacted them or how proposed policies could impact them.
