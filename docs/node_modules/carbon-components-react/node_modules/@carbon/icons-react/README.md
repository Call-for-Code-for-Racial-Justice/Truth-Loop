# @carbon/icons-react

> React components for icons in digital and software products using the Carbon
> Design System

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/icons-react` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/icons-react
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/icons-react
```

## Usage

Icons in this package support the following sizes: `16`, `20`, `24`, and `32`
pixels. These sizes refer to the width and height of the icon. You can import an
icon component into your project by doing one of the following:

```jsx
import Add24 from '@carbon/icons-react/es/add/16';
```

We also provide CommonJS and UMD files in the `lib` and `umd` directories,
respectively.

To import using CommonJS, you can do the following:

```js
const Add24 = require('@carbon/icons-react/lib/Add/24');
```

_Note: if you would like to find the import path for an icon, you can reference
our [icon preview](https://carbon-elements.netlify.com/icons/examples/preview/)_
