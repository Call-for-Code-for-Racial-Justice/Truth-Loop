## Short description

### What's the problem?

Concerned and impacted citizens don't have a straightforward way of knowing what or how policies and regulations impact them or what they can do in response.

### How can technology help?

Our application will allow users to:
* Explore current and proposed policies in a bite sized format
* See how these policies affect or will affect areas of concern to the user
* Share their stories and experiences with fellow residents and policy makers
* Aggregate sentiment on policy
* Find more opportunities for dialogue between residents and policy makers
